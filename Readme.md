# Compilers: There and Back Again

A (very tall) hobbits tale, by serialhex.

But really, it's Abdulaziz Ghuloum's "Compilers: Backend to Frontend and Back to Front Again".
His paper (plus chez scheme, which is the scheme you need) are in the `artifacts` directory.

Just going through it, so I can learn a thing.

...also nasm should be added I think... maybe...
